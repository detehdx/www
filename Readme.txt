FAQ

--- 

- How can pieces be moved?

You have to click over the square where the piece is, and after that you have to click over the square where you want to move it. Do not drag the pieces!



- Is it possible to make a Castling move?

You have to select the king and after that, click over the square where the king will finish after the castling move (two squares right, or two squares left)



- How can I exit the game?

Press escape key.



- The game tells me that a "DLL" file is missing. Why?

That happens when you have not installed the correct version of DirectX in your computer. The game needs DirectX 8 or better. You can download it free in http://www.microsoft.com/directx



- When I try to run the game, it returns me to the Windows desktop.

That usually happens when you have not unzipped the game correctly. Unzip it again or download it from the official site.



- When I run the game I only see a black screen or wrong colors.

Just download the latest drivers of your card. Some very old cards have been considered obsoletes by their manufacturers and there are no new drivers that support DirectX 8. Try to find some compatible drivers.
